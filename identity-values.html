       <h1 class="heading ">Explain a situation where you have made an ethical decision.</h1>

      <p class="script"> I guess the only thing I can think of is deciding to apply for Dev Academy. 
       To be honest it wasn’t much of an ethical decision and more about whether or not I have it in me to achieve such a thing. 
       I meditated on it and weighed my strengths and weakness and went for it.</p>

       <h3>Describe how your culture and the people around you have influenced your values and identity.</h3>

      <p class="script">Well I come from a village in Zimbabwe and in our culture we strive on Handwork, Perseverance and a determination to achieve even if the chips are down. 
        My mum and dad have been my biggest supporters of me pursuing this programme. They have taught me to be proud of the things that I make happen more so than what happens to me.
         My identity to me is just is. I am no different to an apple or a tree. It’s whether or not I can survive another winter/sprint and keep moving forward.</p>

       <h4>Evaluate your limitations in terms of your learning and career development. How might these affect your learning journey?</h4>

       <p class="script">Again the limitations come from a “I won’t call for help just yet “ attitude . 
        It stifles my learning and career development and it will affect my learning journey if I don’t apply that help button a little sooner.. 
        Its a lot like racing. You think you can break a lot later but over time as you go around lap after lap you realise the tyres become more worn out. 
        This results in adjusting to an earlier braking zone but knowing me I like to live life on the edge so I would naturally break later/ ask for help later after coding for 6 hours straight and wonder why i am struggling. 
Its important to take breaks and break down your stints/work load into sections throughout the day so it becomes easier to manage.</p>
